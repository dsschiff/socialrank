Main source file: 
socialrank.cpp

To compile:
g++ -o socialrank socialrank.cpp

Input files (directed graph):
To run the socialrank algorithm, you need to first have the .nodes and .edges files corresponding to your graph ready.
Check out an example graph in the example/ directory (sample.nodes and sample.edges).

.nodes format (1 row per node):
<nodeid> <label>

.edges format (1 row per directed edge):
<src_nodeid> <dest_nodeid>


To run the algorithm, simply run:
./socialrank summary_stats.txt graphname > debug.log
(You need to have the files graphname.nodes and graphname.edges)

Outputs:
summary_stats.txt - Summary statistics
graphname.ranks - The rank of each node in graph

socialrank.py: a Python wrapper script that internally calls the ./socialrank binary
Usage: 
python framework.py summary.txt samplegraph.nodes samplegraph.edges > debug.log
